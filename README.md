# FEniCS-Examples
Welcome to my head while I learn how to use the FEniCS Project toolbox for performing finite element analysis with a focus on biological soft matter. Currently, the projects are as follows:

1.) goodCube: A 3D electrostatics problem in which a cube with a small conductivity is immersed in a larger cube of a larger conductivity               involving the solution to Poisson's equation
